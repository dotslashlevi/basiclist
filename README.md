# basiclist
A Basic but powerful adblock list. Maintained by the community!

# Adding to your ad blocker:
The Process is different for most ad blockers, but most of the time you want to go to a "Custom Filters" or "Custom Lists" section.

It could also be called "Block Lists" or "Filter Lists".

Find the area where you add the blocklist and place this url:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotslashlevi/basiclist/main/basic.txt
```

If that doesn't work try
```
https://github.com/dotslashlevi/basiclist/raw/main/basic.txt
```

Then press Okay or Add!
