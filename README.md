# BasicList
A Basic but powerful adblock list. Maintained by the community!

# What does this block?

This blocks Google ads and analytics, as well as common pornography sites.

It will soon block Microsoft analytics and ads, as well as a list of what I consider "unsafe" search engines.

# Adding to your ad blocker:

*Note: This is for AdBlockers using the AdBlockPlus Syntax.

The Process is different for most ad blockers, but most of the time you want to go to the area where you add custom blocklists.

Then you want to paste this URL.

```

```

Then apply it, and the list will do its work.
